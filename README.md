# Makers-overview
A brief overview of the various projects I completed at Makers Academy (January 2016 - April 2016).

## Main projects
I spent the last weeks of Makers working on larger, team-based projects.

#### Graduation - *Love it or leave it*
- A webapp analysing the current sentiment of a search term through social media analysis. Pitched, designed and deployed in less than two weeks. Technologies used: AngularJS, Rails, Twitter REST API.
- Deployed on Heroku: [Love it or leave it](http://loveit-leaveit.herokuapp.com/)
- Github: [eilw/sentiment-analysis](https://github.com/eilw/sentiment-analysis)

#### Makerthon - *Whos round is it anyway?*
- A new concept for sharing group expenses through a lightweight, mobilefriendly webapp. Designed and built in 3 days. Technologies used: AngularJS, Rails, PostgreSQL. 
- Github:  [Whoâ€™s round is it anyway?](https://github.com/eilw/whos-round-is-it-anyway)

## Weekend Challenges
On most weekends during Makers, I completed an individual project that built on what I had learnt the week leading up.

**Week 8: Angular To-do list** - Created a small to-do list manager in AngularJS as a way to get more familiar with Angular. [Github](https://github.com/eilw/Makers-wkend-challenges/tree/master/wk8-angular-todo-list-challenge)

**Week 7: Instagram challenge** - Created a clone of Instagram in Rails. Including the image filters.  [Github](https://github.com/eilw/Makers-wkend-challenges/tree/master/wk7-instagram-challenge)
